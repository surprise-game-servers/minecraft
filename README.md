# Dockerized Minecraft

Spins up a simple Minecraft server for you and your buddies.

## Disclaimer

Honestly, this isn't *as* good as [ITZG](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server). This project has over 100 contributors and their scripting achieves so much more than what I have done here.

The only reason this project exists is to demonstrate the absolute core basics for those of us who like to run our own custom containers.

## Infos

CentOS based container. Builds OpenJDK-16.0.2 from source, creates and configures the MC volume in Docker and pulls the server jar down.

No need for a start script; just used an endpoint to achieve the exact same thing.

## Environment Variables

| MC_MAX_RAM            |"1G"           | Max RAM that Minecraft can use.                                                                                        |
| MC_MIN_RAM            |"1G"           | Minimum amount of RAM for Minecraft to run with. Often set to max.                                                     |
| MCGID                 |"1000"         | UNIX Group ID. Configurable so that you can make it match a user on your host for cross compatible permissions.        |
| MCUID                 |"1000"         | UNIX User ID. Configurable so that you can make it match a user on your host for cross compatible permissions.         |
| MC_SERVER_DL_URL      | In DF         | The endpoint to pull the Minecraft Server JAR from                                                                     |
| MC_JAVA_DL_URL        | In DF         | The endpoint to pull the OpenJDK source from                                                                           |

## Build & Run

I haven't released this on Docker Hub yet. 

```
docker build . -t mc_server:latest
docker run --name my_mc_server -p 25565:25565/tcp mc_server:latest
## If on RH
#firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=25565/tcp
#firewall-cmd --reload
## If on Deb
#ufw allow 25565/tcp
```

## Extended to run a central repo of jars

If you're running a host or whatever you can just map /jar/ to a folder containing your binaries. It will run whatever jar is called `/jar/minecraft_server_1.17.1.jar`.
